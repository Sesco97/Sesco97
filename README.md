## Hi there, nice to meet you 👋

I'm Francesco Rettore and I'm a Mathematical Engineering, currently working as **Data Scientist with a focus in Artificial Intelligence**.
I recently graduated from Politecnico di Milano with a Master Thesis about **Augmented Reality** and **Applied Mathematics**, with title: *Augmented Reality in racing applications: development of a framework for Heading Estimation and camera Automatic Boresighting*.
My research interest lies in the application of **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **AI** in different domains.

🎓 **Education:**
- Master of Science in Mathematical Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`
- Bachelor of Science in Information Engineering at `Università degli Studi di Padova`

📌 **Projects:**
- [Intelligent Athlete](https://github.com/Sesco97/Intelligent-Athlete): development of a classifier to keep track of the exercises performed by an athlete during a workout session.
- [Graphical Models for Categorical Data - Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/Sesco97/GraphicalModels-BayesStat): development of Bayesian methods for the analysis of multivariate categorical data to infer dependence relations between categorical variables, represented by graphical models.
- [Leaf Classification - AN2DL](https://github.com/Sesco97/LeafClassification-AN2DL): implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to classify images of leaves according to the species of the plant to which they belong.
- [Time Series Forecasting - AN2DL](https://github.com/Sesco97/TimeSeriesForecasting-AN2DL): implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in order to forecast seven different signals over a time horizon of 864 time samples.
